"Blade Weaver," aka "Tower B-40," is a game I first created in 2017, with a few iterations over the years.
I began developing it in 2023, and it is still ongoing as a side project, planned for release in the future.

- Optimized pathfinding over long distances by combining graph-based and grid-based A* pathfinding algorithms, improving performance and precision
- Live pixel-perfect rendering to align on-screen elements to world grid while maintaining classic pixel art aesthetic
- Mesh-based "wings" with precise, live vertex calculations for fluid and dynamic visuals in combat
- Enemy AI with state machine architecture that predicts player movement and calculates target positions for each limb for optimal movement in physical environment
- Live inverse-kinematics calculations
- Background parallaxing and smooth camera controls for optimal player experience
- Mechanical SFXs designed using frequency modulation synthesis
- Audio pooling for fast, on-demand audio source generation
